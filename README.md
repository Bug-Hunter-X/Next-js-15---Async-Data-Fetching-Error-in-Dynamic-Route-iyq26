# Next.js 15 - Async Data Fetching Error in Dynamic Route

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when fetching asynchronous data within a dynamic route in Next.js 15.  The problem arises from improper handling of asynchronous operations, leading to unexpected behavior and errors during rendering.

## Problem Description

The `pages/about.js` attempts to fetch data using `await fetchData()` before the component renders.  This can lead to hydration mismatch errors or unexpected behavior depending on the timing of the data fetch.  Improper error handling can make diagnosing the problem challenging.

## Solution

The provided solution uses `async/await` and `try...catch` to handle the asynchronous data fetching properly.  This ensures the component gracefully handles errors, preventing unexpected behavior or rendering issues.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to `/about`.

The original code will likely throw an error. After applying the solution, the route will load correctly.
